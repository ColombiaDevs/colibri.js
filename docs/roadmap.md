# Microtasks Roadmap for Colibrí.js

> **"From small tasks, great achievements"**
> A detailed roadmap of microtasks for the collaborative development of Colibrí.js

## Introduction

This document complements the [general roadmap](./roadmap.md) with specific and actionable microtasks for each phase of the Colibrí.js project. The microtasks are designed to be self-contained, well-defined, and accessible for contributors with different levels of experience.

Each microtask follows the template defined in the [development plan](./development-plan.md), which includes:

- Unique identifier and descriptive title
- Complexity level and estimated time
- Technical requirements and acceptance criteria
- Resources and dependencies
- Learning opportunities

## Document Structure

This microtasks roadmap is organized according to the phases defined in the main roadmap:

- [Phase 0: MVP (Weeks 1-2)](#phase-0-mvp-weeks-1-2)
- [Phase 1: Component System and Hooks (Weeks 3-5)](#phase-1-component-system-and-hooks-weeks-3-5)
- [Phase 2: Developer Tools (Weeks 6-8)](#phase-2-developer-tools-weeks-6-8)
- [Phase 3: Plugin and Theme Ecosystem (Weeks 9-12)](#phase-3-plugin-and-theme-ecosystem-weeks-9-12)
- [Phase 4: Preparation for 1.0 Launch (Weeks 13-16)](#phase-4-preparation-for-10-launch-weeks-13-16)

To understand how the SOLID principles are applied through these tasks, also check the [SOLID principles](./solid-principles.md) document where each principle and its implementation in Colibrí.js is explained in detail.

## Conclusion

This microtasks roadmap provides a detailed plan for the collaborative development of Colibrí.js from initial MVP to the 1.0 release. By breaking down the work into small, manageable tasks with clear requirements, dependencies, and deliverables, we aim to facilitate contributions from developers of all experience levels.

The roadmap is designed to be flexible and may evolve as the project progresses. We encourage contributors to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.

**Together, we build a better web, one microtask at a time.**
