## 6. Collaborative Development Infrastructure

### 6.1 Zero-Config Development Environment

A core principle of Colibrí.js is minimizing the barrier to entry for new contributors. Our zero-configuration development environment enables developers to begin contributing immediately without complex setup processes.

#### 6.1.1 Local Setup

```bash
# One command to set up the entire development environment
npm run setup

# Start development server with file watching
npm run dev

# Run tests for a specific component or feature
npm run test:focus <component-name>

# Generate documentation locally
npm run docs:dev
```

The setup script performs the following automatically:

- Installation of all dependencies with correct versions
- Configuration of Git hooks for code quality checks
- Generation of TypeScript type definitions
- Setup of test environment with proper mocking
- Configuration of linting and formatting tools

#### 6.1.2 Cloud Development

- **GitHub Codespaces Integration**:
  - Pre-configured development environment with zero setup
  - All dependencies and tools pre-installed
  - VS Code recommended extensions automatically configured
  - Persistent workspace for ongoing development
  - Seamless GitHub integration for branches and PRs

- **Gitpod Configuration**:
  - Alternative cloud-based environment
  - Same pre-installed toolset and configurations
  - Launchable directly from the repository with a single click
  - Multi-workspace support for complex development needs
  - Collaborative features for pair programming sessions

### 6.2 Task Management CLI System

A comprehensive command-line interface helps contributors navigate tasks, verify their work, and integrate their contributions seamlessly.

```bash
# View all available tasks
npm run tasks:list

# Filter tasks by difficulty level
npm run tasks:list --difficulty=beginner

# Filter tasks by module or technology
npm run tasks:list --module=core --tech=reactivity

# Start working on a task (sets up branch and context)
npm run task:start <task-id>

# Check if current work meets all acceptance criteria
npm run task:verify <task-id>

# Prepare a task for submission (runs tests, linting)
npm run task:submit <task-id>

# Generate task report for PR description
npm run task:report <task-id>
```

The CLI system integrates with GitHub to:

- Pull the latest task definitions and requirements
- Track task status and assignments
- Create properly named feature branches
- Generate standardized PR descriptions
- Run pre-submission checks for quality assurance

## 7. Modular Project Structure

### 7.1 Package Organization

Colibrí.js uses a monorepo structure to organize code in a modular way, enabling independent development of components while maintaining clear boundaries and integration points.

```plaintext

```

### 7.2 Module Independence Principles

#### 7.2.1 Interface Contracts

- Each module defines explicit public interfaces that serve as contracts
- Disruptive interface changes require a major version bump
- Interface documentation automatically generated from code with TypeScript
- Versioned interface stability guarantees for different development stages
- Cross-module interface compatibility testing

#### 7.2.2 Dependency Rules

To maintain modularity and avoid entangled code, the project follows strict dependency rules:

- **Core module has zero external dependencies**
  - Focused on pure functionality without third-party code
  - Uses only native browser APIs and JavaScript features
  - Self-contained with no imports from other packages

- **Plugins depend only on specific core interfaces**
  - Limited access to internal APIs through well-defined contracts
  - Explicit declaration of required core version compatibility
  - Isolated from other plugins unless explicitly declaring dependencies

- **Circular dependencies are prohibited**
  - Automatically verified by dependency analysis tools
  - Build system fails if circular dependencies are detected
  - Documentation provides dependency graphs for visualization

#### 7.2.3 Testing in Isolation

Each module must be testable independently of others:

- **Independent test suites**
  - Every module has its own comprehensive test suite
  - Tests run in isolation without requiring other modules
  - Coverage requirements enforced per module (90%+ target)

- **Mock systems for cross-module dependencies**
  - Standard mocking patterns for all module interfaces
  - Test helpers provided for common dependencies
  - Interface contract testing to ensure mocks match real behavior

- **Integration testing as a separate package**
  - Dedicated integration test suite for cross-module verification
  - End-to-end tests for complete user flows
  - Performance benchmarks across module boundaries

### 7.3 Plugin Architecture

#### 7.3.1 Plugin System Design

The plugin system is a core architectural feature enabling extensibility:

- **Standardized registration mechanism**
  - Uniform API for plugin registration across all extension points
  - Plugin manifest schema for declaring capabilities and requirements
  - Automatic dependency resolution between plugins

- **Well-defined extension points**
  - Documented API surface for each extensible area
  - Versioning of extension point interfaces
  - Stability guarantees for plugin authors

- **Lifecycle hooks for plugins**
  - Initialization and cleanup phases
  - Resource management and registration
  - Conditional activation based on environment

- **Inter-plugin dependency declaration**
  - Explicit requirements between plugins
  - Optional dependencies with graceful fallbacks
  - Version compatibility ranges

#### 7.3.2 Plugin Types

The framework supports several plugin categories, each with specific purposes:

- **Compiler Plugins**
  - Extend the template compilation process
  - Add custom directives and syntax features
  - Optimize output for specific targets
  - Transform templates with additional capabilities
  - Integrate with build tools and bundlers

- **Runtime Plugins**
  - Add functionality to components at runtime
  - Provide new lifecycle hooks or behaviors
  - Enhance rendering capabilities
  - Implement cross-cutting concerns like logging or analytics
  - Extend the core API with additional utilities

- **Tooling Plugins**
  - Extend the development experience
  - Add commands to the CLI
  - Integrate with the playground
  - Provide code generators or templates
  - Add debugging and profiling capabilities
